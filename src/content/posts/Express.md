In modern web development, APIs ( Application Programming Interfaces) are essentials for the communication between different software systems. The APIs work as a bridge that allows the interaction, sharing data and execute functions seamlessly. They are working behind the scenes to make the interactions possible.

APIs are used for a variety of purposes, including:
-  **Data Exchange**: Enabling applications to send and receive data, such as fetching user details from a database.
- **Service Integration**: Connecting different services, like integrating payment gateways or third-party authentication.
- **Automation**: Allowing systems to interact programmatically without human intervention.
- **Security and Access Control**: Managing authentication and authorization for users and services.
- **Abstracting Complex Systems**: APIs provide a simplified interface to complex backend logic, hiding implementation details from users. This allows frontend applications to interact with services without needing to understand the underlying infrastructure.

One of the key challenges in managing multiple APIs is routing, security, and scalability. This is where an API Gateway comes in. An API Gateway acts as a central entry point for handling client requests, directing them to the appropriate backend services, enforcing security policies, and optimizing performance.

In this guide, you'll learn how to build your first API Gateway using Express.js, a popular and lightweight web framework for Node.js. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a solid understanding of how API Gateways work and how they help streamline API management. 

## Setting up:
Now that we understand what an API and an API Gateway are, let’s dive into building one. Our API Gateway will act as a central hub, routing incoming requests from a browser or different systems to our backend services.

### Prerequisites: 
Before we start, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or later ). You can download  it [here](https://nodejs.org/en).
- Express Generator – A tool for quickly scaffolding an Express.js application. Install it globally using:
```bash
npm install -g express-generator
```

#### Step 1: Initialize the project
To create a new Express API, run the following command:
```bash
express <project-name> --git
```
Replace <project-name> with your desired directory name. And the --git flag initializes a Git repository (optional but recommended).

#### Step 2: Install Dependencies & Start the Server
Navigate to your project folder and install the required dependencies:
```bash
cd api
npm install
```
Now, start the application using:
```bash
npm start
```
By default, the server will run on port 3000. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000/
You should see the default Express welcome page.
